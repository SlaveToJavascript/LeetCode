# MEDIUM

# GIVEN:
    # a string, senate, representing the senators from 2 parties, Radiant ("R") and Dire ("D")
    # each senator can either ban a senator of the opposing party, OR 
    # declare victory if there are no opponents left in the senate

# RETURN:
    # the name of the party that will declare victory

# EXAMPLE:
    # Input: senate = "RD"
    # Output: "Radiant"
    # Explanation: 
    # The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
    # And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
    # And in round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

    # Input: senate = "RDD"
    # Output: "Dire"
    # Explanation: 
    # The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
    # And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
    # And the third senator comes from Dire and he can ban the first senator's right in round 1. 
    # And in round 2, the third senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

# âœ… ALGORITHM 1: QUEUES
# Maintain 2 queues, 1 for indexes of R and another for indexes of D
# while both stacks are not empty, dequeue from both stacks and compare indexes
    # -> smaller index senator will ban the other -> gets added back to queue with new index = prev index + length of senator string
# when only one queue is not empty, return the party (Radiant/Dire) of that queue

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)
