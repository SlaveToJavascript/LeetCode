# GIVEN:
    # an array of strings, words
    # a width, maxWidth

# TASK:
    # format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified
    # You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters
    # Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible
        # If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right
    # For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
    # Output:
    # [
    #    "This    is    an",
    #    "example  of text",
    #    "justification.  "
    # ]

    # Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
    # Output:
    # [
    #   "What   must   be",
    #   "acknowledgment  ",
    #   "shall be        "
    # ]
    # Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
    # Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

    # Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
    # Output:
    # [
    #   "Science  is  what we",
    #   "understand      well",
    #   "enough to explain to",
    #   "a  computer.  Art is",
    #   "everything  else  we",
    #   "do                  "
    # ]

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n*w)

    # ' '.join(sentence + [words[i]]) -> constructs a new list and joins it into a string -> O(w) for each word
    # inner for-loop takes O(w) time for each word
    # Overall = O(n*w)
# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
    # sentence array has max length of n
