# GIVEN:
    # m x n grid of characters, board
    # a string, word

# TASK:
    # return true if word exists in the grid
    # The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring
    # The same letter cell may not be used more than once

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
    # Output: true

    # Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
    # Output: true

    # Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
    # Output: false

# âœ… ALGORITHM: BACKTRACKING / DFS

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(m * n * 4^w)
    # m = number of rows
    # n = number of columns
    # w = length of word
    # O(m*n) for nested for loop
    # backtrack() takes 4^(len(word))
        # O(len(word)) for recursion call stack itself (without the 4 calls)
        # since we're calling backtrack() 4 times within each call, TC = O(4^len(word))
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(4^w)
    # w = length of word
    # for recursion call stack
        # O(len(word)) for recursion call stack itself (without the 4 calls)
        # since we're calling backtrack() 4 times within each call, TC = O(4^len(word))
