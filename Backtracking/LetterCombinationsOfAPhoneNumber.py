# GIVEN:
    # a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive

# TASK:
    # return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent
    # Return the answer in any order
    # A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: digits = "23"
    # Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

    # Input: digits = ""
    # Output: []

    # Input: digits = "2"
    # Output: ["a","b","c"]

# âœ… ALGORITHM: BACKTRACKING
# Once the string built is of the same length as digits, we can add it to result array

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n * 4^n), n = length of integer string
    # on average, it should be 3^n, but since 7 and 9 are mapped to 4 digits each, the worst case complexity is 4^n
    # 4^n for building every possible string combination * n to form the string by joining each character
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)
    # the max recursion depth will be n, where n is the length of input string
    # If the space required for ans is considered as well, the complexity will be O(4^n)
