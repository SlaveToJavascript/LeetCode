# There are n courses numbered 1 to n
# There is also a 2D array, relations
    # Inside each nested array contains 2 courses
        # The 1st course is a pre-requisite for the 2nd course
        # That is, you must learn the 1st course in the array before learning the 2nd course in the array
# You may study any number of courses in a semester, provided you have completed all prerequisites for that course in the previous semester
# TODO: Return minimum semester of full coursework, or -1 if full coursework cannot be completed

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: n = 4, relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4]]
    # Output: 3
    # Explanation:
        # Semester 1: Study 1
        # Semester 2: Study 2
        # Semester 3: Study 3, 4

    # Input: n = 4, relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
    # Output: 4
    # Explanation:
        # Semester 1: Study 1
        # Semester 2: Study 2
        # Semester 3: Study 3
        # Semester 4: Study 4

    # Input: n = 2, relations = [[1,2],[2,1]]
    # Output: -1
    # Explanation: To take course 2 you should have finished course 1, and to take course 1 you should also have finished course 2. So it is impossible

# âœ… ALGORITHM: TOPOLOGICAL SORT (BFS, QUEUE)
# Create adjacency list to represent the graph
# Create an in-degree list to represent the number of prerequisites for each course
    # indegree[i] = no. of prerequisites for course i
# Add nodes with in-degree 0 to the queue
    # These represent courses that have no prerequisites and can be taken in the first semester
# Process the queue:
    # For each course, visit its dependents
        # dependents of course i are courses that have course i as a prerequisite
    # Decrease the in-degree for each dependent
    # If a dependent's in-degree becomes 0, it means all its prerequisites are completed and can be added to the queue
# Repeat the processing of queue until all nodes are processed

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(r+n)
    # r = no. of relations (edges)
    # n = no. of courses (nodes)
    # building indegree and adjList: O(r)
    # BFS traversal: Each course is processed exactly once and each relation is also considered exactly once -> O(r+c)
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(r+n)
    # indegree: O(n)
    # adjList: O(r+n) in the worst case
