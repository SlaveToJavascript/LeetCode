# Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a LRU cache
# Implement the LRUCache class:
    # LRUCache(capacity) initializes the LRU cache with positive integer size capacity
    # get(key) returns the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1
    # put(key, value) updates the value of the key if the key exists; otherwise, adds the key-value pair to the cache
        # If the no. of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key
# NOTE: get() and put() must each run in O(1) time complexity

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input:
    # ["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
    # [   [2],    [1, 1], [2, 2], [1],  [3, 3], [2],  [4, 4], [1],    [3],  [4]]
    # Output:
    # [  null,     null,   null,   1,    null,  -1,    null,   -1,     3,    4]

    # Explanation:
    # LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
    # lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
    # lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
    # lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
    # lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
    # lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
    # lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
    # lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
    # lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
    # lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4

# âœ… ALGORITHM 1: HASHMAP + DOUBLY LINKED LIST
# Each item in the cache will be a node within a doubly linked list with key, value, previous and next pointers
# we use doubly linked list since we need track the most and least recently used nodes respectively
    # because the order needs to be preserved and we need to reorder the MRU and LRU quickly
    # the LRU and MRU are 2 nodes of the linked list doubly connected to each other
# Every time after we get() a node or put() a node, update that node to the most recently used
# To do get() operations in O(1) time, we use a hashmap
    # hashmap must be of size = capacity
    # key = key, value = node

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(1) for get() and put()
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)
    # cache (hashmap) = O(n)
    # doubly linked list = O(n)
    # total = ~ O(2n)
