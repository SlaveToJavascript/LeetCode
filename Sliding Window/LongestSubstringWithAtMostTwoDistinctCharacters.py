# MEDIUM
# Tags: slidingwindowlc, hashmaplc, premiumlc, #159

# GIVEN:
    # string, s

# TASK:
    # return the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: s = "eceba"
    # Output: 3
    # Explanation: The substring is "ece" which its length is 3.

    # Input: s = "ccaabbb"
    # Output: 5
    # Explanation: The substring is "aabbb" which its length is 5.

# âœ… ALGORITHM: SLIDING WINDOW
# use a sliding window to keep track of the longest substring with at most two distinct characters
# use a hashmap to store the count of each character in the current substring
# if the count of distinct characters in the current substring is greater than 2, shrink the window from the left until the count of distinct characters is 2
# update the max length of the substring

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
    # additional space is used only for a hashmap with at most 3 elements

            distinct_chars[s[l]] -= 1 # shrink the window from the left
            if distinct_chars[s[l]] == 0: # if the count of the char at l pointer is 0,
