# GIVEN:
    # integer array, nums
    # integer, k

# TASK:
    # Find a contiguous subarray of length = k that has the max avg value and return this value

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
    # Output: 12.75000
    # Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75

    # Input: nums = [5], k = 1
    # Output: 5.00000

# âœ… ALGORITHM: SLIDING WINDOW
# We don't need to calculate the average of each subarray!
# Since the sum of each subarray is divided by the same no. (4), goal is basically to find subarray with the max sum
# Instead of computing the sum of subarrays over and over, can simply subtract first element of subarray and add next element after subarray to find the sum of next subarray

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
    # We iterate over the given nums array of length n once only
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

def findMaxAverage(nums, k):
    k_sum = sum(nums[:k]) # initialize sum of 1st window
    max_sum = k_sum # initialize max sum as sum of 1st window
    l = 0 # l points to the element before the start of the 2nd window
    r = k # r points to the last element of the 2nd window
    while r < len(nums):
        k_sum = k_sum - nums[l] + nums[r] # 2nd window onwards: remove 1st element of previous window and add last element of current window
        max_sum = max(max_sum, k_sum)
        l += 1
        r += 1
    return max_sum/float(k)
