# Tags: slidingwindowlc, hashmaplc, #76

# GIVEN:
    # 2 strings, s and t, of lengths m and n respectively

# TASK:
    # return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window
    # If there is no such substring, return the empty string ""

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
    # Output: "BANC"
    # Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

    # Input: s = "a", t = "a"
    # Output: "a"
    # Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

    # Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
    # Output: ""
    # Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
    # Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
