# Tags: binarysearchlc, googlelc, interviewlc

# Your task is to write a function that given a distance d and a stream of floating point values received one at a time, checking for groups of three values that are within at most d distance.
# As values are received they should be stored in memory.
# Whenever any group is found meeting the distance criteria, return the three values and remove them from memory.
# REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:
# Imagine you are standing at an incoming conveyor belt of items that need to be packaged into boxes of exactly three items that all fit together (means that all items are within distance d of each other) and placed on a second, outgoing, conveyor belt
# You have sufficient storage space to place items off to the side while you wait for a full triplet that all fit together.
# Conveyor belt items are floating point numbers.

# EXAMPLE USAGE

for item in stream:
    group = system.process_item(item)
