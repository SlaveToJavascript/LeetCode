# GIVEN:
    # m x n 2D binary grid, grid, which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water)
    # You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water

# TASK:
    # Return the maximum area of an island in grid
    # The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
                #    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
                #    [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
                #    [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
                #    [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
                #    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
                #    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
                #    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
    # Output: 6
    # Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

    # Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
    # Output: 0

# âœ… ALGORITHM 1: RECURSIVE DFS
# nested for loop to visit each node and call recursive dfs function on each node
# recursive dfs function returns 0 if node is out of bounds, or is water, or is visited
# returns size after it finishes traversing an island

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(mn)
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(mn)
