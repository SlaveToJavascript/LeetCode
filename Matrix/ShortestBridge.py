# GIVEN:
    # an n x n binary matrix, grid, where 1 represents land and 0 represents water
    # An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1's not connected to any other 1's
    # There are exactly 2 islands in grid

# TASK:
    # You may change 0's to 1's to connect the two islands to form one island
    # Return the smallest number of 0's you must flip to connect the two islands

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
    # Output: 1

    # Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
    # Output: 2

    # Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]
    # Output: 1

# âœ… ALGORITHM 1: DFS + BFS
# Question is basically asking for the shortest path between the 2 islands
# After doing DFS to get all coords of land cells of the 1st island, do BFS to get shortest path between 2 islands
    # BFS lets us get the layers that are 4-directionally surrounding the 1st island
    # As we get each layer, we increase our bridge length by 1
    # When any cell from the 2nd island falls within a layer, we return our bridge length
# NOTE: we don't need to visit 2nd island or do DFS for it, since we just need to find bridge length between the 2 islands, so we return bridge length as soon as any cells from 2nd island falls within the BFS layers that we get from the BFS function

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n^2)
    # nested for-loop iterating grid
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n^2)
    # for visited hashset and BFS queue

        # e.g. visited = { (x, y), (i, j), ... }
