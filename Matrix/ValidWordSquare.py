# Tags: matrixlc, premiumlc, #422

# GIVEN:
    # an array of strings, words

# TASK:
    # return true if it forms a valid word square
        # A sequence of strings forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the same string

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: words = ["abcd","bnrt","crmy","dtye"]
    # Output: true
    # Explanation:
        # ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
        # ['b', 'n', 'r', 't']
        # ['c', 'r', 'm', 'y']
        # ['d', 't', 'y', 'e']
    # The 1st row and 1st column both read "abcd".
    # The 2nd row and 2nd column both read "bnrt".
    # The 3rd row and 3rd column both read "crmy".
    # The 4th row and 4th column both read "dtye".
    # Therefore, it is a valid word square.

    # Input: words = ["abcd","bnrt","crm","dt"]
    # Output: true
    # Explanation:
        # ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
        # ['b', 'n', 'r', 't']
        # ['c', 'r', 'm', ' ']
        # ['d', 't', ' ', ' ']
    # The 1st row and 1st column both read "abcd".
    # The 2nd row and 2nd column both read "bnrt".
    # The 3rd row and 3rd column both read "crm".
    # The 4th row and 4th column both read "dt".
    # Therefore, it is a valid word square.

    # Input: words = ["ball","area","read","lady"]
    # Output: false
    # Explanation:
        # ['b', 'a', 'l', 'l']
        # ['a', 'r', 'e', 'a']
        # ['r', 'e', 'a', 'd']
        # ['l', 'a', 'd', 'y']
    # The 3rd row reads "read" while the 3rd column reads "lead".
    # Therefore, it is NOT a valid word square.

# âœ… ALGORITHM: COMPARE DIAGONAL LETTERS OF MATRIX TO ENSURE THEY ARE EQUAL
# for a matrix to be valid, each matrix[r][c] char must be equal to matrix[r][c] char for all r, c within matrix -> check each matrix[r][c]
# NOTE: if we cannot form a square matrix, then it's definitely invalid

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n^2)
    # for the nested for-loop
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
    # for the constant variables

    for i in range(len(words)):

            words[i] += (n-len(words[i])) * [""] # pad it with empty strings to make it the same length as the longest word
