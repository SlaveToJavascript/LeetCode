# GIVEN:
    # n * n matrix, grid, of 0's and 1's

# TASK:
    # Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing grid
    # Quad-tree = a tree where each non-leaf node has exactly 4 children
        # Each node has 2 properties: 
            # 1) val (node.val = 0 if node represents grid of all 0's; node.val = 1 if node represents grid of all 1's)
            # 2) isLeaf (node.isLeaf = 1 if node is leaf node; node.isLeaf = 0 otherwise)
        # Each non-leaf node also has 4 more properties: topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight (for its 4 children respectively)
    # To construct a quad-tree from a 2D array:
        # If all vals within current grid/subgrid are the same (i.e all 1's or all 0's), set isLeaf = 1 and set val = value of the grid and set the 4 children (topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight) to null and stop
        # If cells within current grid/subgrid have different values, set isLeaf = 0 and set val = any value and divide the current grid into 4 subgrids (which would represent its 4 children respectively)
        # Recurse for each of the children with the smaller subgrid

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
    # Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
    # Explanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:
    # Notice that 0 represnts False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.

    # Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
    # Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
    # Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
    # The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
    # The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.

# âœ… ALGORITHM 1: RECURSION
# Starting with original grid, check if all vals in grid are the same
    # If yes, create and return leaf node and end
    # If no, split grid into 4 subgrids and recursively pass each subgrid into the function
        # Create a root node and set its 4 children to the 4 nodes returned from the recursive function
# Return the root

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n^2 log n)
    # n^2 = max possible no. of leaf nodes (when every cell in grid is a leaf node)
    # log n = height of the resulting quad tree (since we divide n/2 for every level)
    # at every level in the tree, we are iterating over the entire tree
        # n^2 = original grid split into 4 quadrants -> check if all cells within each quadrant has the same value
        # n^2 = each 1/4 quadrant of original grid is split into 4 quadrants -> we have 4 smaller quadrants, but we still have to iterate each smaller quandrant to check if all values within a quadrant are the same
        # ...repeat the splitting until each quandrant has length = 1 -> total complexity = n^2 + n^2 + n^2 + ... = log n * n^2
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(log n)
    # the recurrence relation follows a binary tree structure, where each level of the tree represents a subproblem of size n/(2^k), where k is the level number
    # no. of levels in the tree = log(n) because the subproblem size reduces by half at each level
