# Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
    # Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    # Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    # Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Note:
    # A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
    # Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: board = 
    # [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
    # ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
    # ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
    # ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
    # ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
    # ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
    # ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
    # ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
    # ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
    # Output: true

    # Input: board = 
    # [["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
    # ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
    # ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
    # ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
    # ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
    # ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
    # ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
    # ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
    # ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
    # Output: false
    # Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

# âœ… ALGORITHM: BRUTE FORCE
# 1. Check each row for duplicates
# 2. Check each column for duplicates
# 3. Check each 3x3 subgrid for duplicates
    # get the (r,c) coords of the top-left cell of each 3x3 subgrid and iterate within each 3x3 subgrid to check for duplicates
# 4. If any duplicates are found, return False
# 5. Return True

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(1)
    # since the board is always a 9x9 matrix
    # if board is NxN, then time complexity is O(N^2)
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1) 
    # since we are not using any extra space
