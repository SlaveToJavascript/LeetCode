# GIVEN:
    # integer array, nums

# TASK:
    # return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]],
    # such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0
    # solution set must not contain duplicate triplets

# âœ… ALGORITHM: TWO POINTERS
# (Repetition of Two Sum Set II except with 1 pointer iterating whole array, and 2 other pointers iterating rest of array)
# Sort nums array
# use p1 to iterate through all elements in nums
    # p1 is a fixed target for current iteration, i.e. while p2 and p3 are shifting to get target, p1 remains pointing to the same element
    # therefore, target for p2+p3 for each iteration of p1 = -target (since the target sum is 0)
# initialize p2 to point to next element after p1
# initialize p3 to point to last element in nums
# keep comparing if p2+p3 less than/greater than/equals target
    # if p2+p3 less than target, need to increase p2+p3 sum -> shift p2 to the right
    # if p2+p3 more than target, need to decrease p2+p3 sum -> shift p3 to the left
    # if p2+p3 = target, add [p1, p2, p3] to result, and shift both p2 and p3 to the right and left respectively
        # but before adding [p1, p2, p3] to result, first check if it already exists in result array -> this is to prevent duplicates in result

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n^2)
    # O(n log n) for sorting nums array
    # O(n^2) for for-while nested loop
        # for-loop iterates each element of nums -> O(n)
        # at each element in nums, in the worst case, p2 and p3 iterate the whole of the remaining array to the right of p1 -> O(n) in the worst case
        # -> Overall TC = O(n^2)
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)
    # Python sort function requires O(n) space

def threeSum(nums):
    nums.sort()
    result = []

    # initialize the 3 pointers
    for p1 in range(len(nums)-2): # end iteration at index len(nums)-3 so last 2 positions are for 2nd and 3rd pointers
        p2 = p1 + 1 # p2 is initialized to the index after p1
        p3 = len(nums)-1 # p3 initialized to last element in nums
        target = -nums[p1] # required sum of p2 and p3 = 0-nums[p1]

        # Traverse the list to find the triplet whose sum equals 0
        while p2 < p3:
            if nums[p2] + nums[p3] < target: # if sum less than target, we have to increase sum -> shift left pointer to the right (since nums is sorted, this will increase sum)
                p2 += 1
            elif nums[p2] + nums[p3] > target: # if sum more than target, we have to decrease sum -> shift right pointer to the left (since nums is sorted, this will decrease sum)
                p3 -= 1
            else: # nums[p2] + nums[p3] == target
                output = [nums[p1], nums[p2], nums[p3]]
                if output not in result: # check if output in result first to prevent repetition
                    result.append(output)
                p2 += 1
                p3 -= 1
