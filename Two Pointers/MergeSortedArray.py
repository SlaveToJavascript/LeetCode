# https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/

# GIVEN:
    # two sorted integer arrays, nums1 and nums2

# TASK:
    # Merge and return nums1 and nums2 as a single sorted array
    # nums1 has m integers and nums2 has n integers
    # NOTE: modify nums1 in-place without returning the answer

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
    # Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
    # Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
    # The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

    # Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
    # Output: [1]
    # Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
    # The result of the merge is [1].

    # Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
    # Output: [1]
    # Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
    # The result of the merge is [1].
    # Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

# âœ… ALGORITHM 1: PYTHON SORT()
# Put nums2 elements into nums1, then sort nums1 with Python sort() function

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O((n+m)log(n+m))
    # Python sort() function has O(n log n) runtime
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

def merge(nums1, m, nums2, n):
    for i in range(n):
        nums1[m+i] = nums2[i] # replace trailing 0's in num1 with num2 elements
    nums1.sort() # O(n logn)

#============================================================================================================

# âœ… ALGORITHM 2: TWO POINTERS
# Since the 0's in nums1 are at the end, it's easier to fill in the values from the end of nums1
    # i.e. from right to left
# 2 pointers: 1 pointing to the last digit of nums1, 1 at the last digit of nums2
# 1 pointer keeps track of end of nums1 (endpointer)
# if pointer1 val is greater than pointer2 val:
    # move pointer1 val to endpointer of nums1; pointer1 moves left, endpointer moves left
# else (if pointer2 val > pointer1 val):
    # move pointer2 val to endpointer of nums1; pointer2 moves left, endpointer moves left
# *** LAST STEP: fill nums1 with leftover nums2 elements (if any)

def merge(nums1, m, nums2, n):
    p1, p2 = m-1, n-1
    end_p = len(nums1)-1

    while p2 >= 0 and p1 >= 0:
        if nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]:
            nums1[end_p] = nums1[p1]
            p1 -= 1
        else:
            nums1[end_p] = nums2[p2]
            p2 -= 1
        end_p -= 1
    
    # fill nums1 with leftover nums2 elements (if any)
    while p2 >= 0:
        nums1[end_p] = nums2[p2]
        end_p -= 1
        p2 -= 1
