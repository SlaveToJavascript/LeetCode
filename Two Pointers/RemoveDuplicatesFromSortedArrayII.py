# GIVEN:
    # sorted integer array, nums

# TASK:
    # remove duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice
    # have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums
    # if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result
    # NOTE: Do not allocate extra space for another array

# RETURN: k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
    # Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
    # Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
    # It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

    # Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
    # Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
    # Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
    # It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

            # both are equal, meaning there is a duplicate and updation needed
            # left remains at the same index (which needs to be updated), while right continues incrementing to find the next no. that is different (to update left with it)
        if nums[right] != nums[left-2]: # no duplicate OR a different no. is found
            # no.s are different, meaning it can be used to replace the repeated no.
            nums[left] = nums[right] # replace the number at left which was needed to be replaced
