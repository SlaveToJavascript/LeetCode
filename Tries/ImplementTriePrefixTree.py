# A trie or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings
# There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker

# Implement the Trie class:
    # Trie() Initializes the trie object.
    # insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.
    # search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
    # startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input
    # ["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]
    # [[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]
    # Output
    # [null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

    # Explanation
    # Trie trie = new Trie();
    # trie.insert("apple");
    # trie.search("apple");   // return True
    # trie.search("app");     // return False
    # trie.startsWith("app"); // return True
    # trie.insert("app");
    # trie.search("app");     // return True
