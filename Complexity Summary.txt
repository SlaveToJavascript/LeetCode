V = no. of vertices (nodes)
E = no. of edges

Time Complexity:
    Recursive DFS: O(V + E)
    Iterative DFS (stack): O(V)
    BFS (queue): O(V)
        need to traverse all nodes

Space Complexity:
    Recursive DFS: O(b * h)
        b = branching factor of each node, i.e. how many children each node has
        h = max height of graph/tree
    Iterative DFS (stack): O(V)
        at worst case you need to hold all vertices in the stack
    BFS (queue): O(V)
        at worst case you need to hold all vertices in the queue
