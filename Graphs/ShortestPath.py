# GIVEN:
    # list of edges for an undirected graph
    # source node
    # destination node

# TASK:
    # find and return the length of the shortest path between source and destination nodes
    # each edge has a length of 1
    # if there is no path is found between source and destination, return -1

# âœ… ALGORITHM: ITERATIVE BFS
# NOTE: BFS is typically used for questions looking for "shortest path"
    # because BFS traverses the graph level-by-level outwards from the start -> the first time we encounter the destination, that must be 
# Create a 2D array queue which is used to store each node + its distance from source
    # i.e. [node, distance]
# Create a set visited which is used to store visited nodes (since it's an undirected graph)

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(e), e = no. of edges
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n), n = no. of nodes
