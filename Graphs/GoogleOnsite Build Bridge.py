# We are trying to build a bridge across an m x n river
# Each day, we build a bridge cell on the river. The bridge cell can be anywhere on the river and does not have to be in sequential order along a path
# bridges is an array of coordinates of the bridge cells built in order, where bridges[i] is the coordinates of the bridge cell built on the ith day
# Given bridges, return the minimum number of days required to build a complete bridge (made up of bridge cells) across the river, where we can get from the left side to the right side
# if we are unable to build a bridge that connects the left and right sides of the river, return -1

# EXAMPLE:
# bridges = [(4,3), (3,2), (1,0), (1,1), (0,3), (2,1), (3,1), (4,2), (4,0)], m = 5, n = 4
# The bridge cells are marked B in the matrix below
# |   B|
# |BB  |
# | B  |
# | BB |
# |B BB|

# return: 7
# Explanation: A complete bridge can be built from the given bridge cells. We need 7 days to build the complete bridge
