# GIVEN:
    # an undirected weighted graph of n nodes represented by an edge list where edges[i] = [a, b] is an undirected edge connecting the nodes a and b with a probability of success of traversing that edge succProb[i]
    # 2 nodes, start and end

# TASK:
    # find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from start to end and return its success probability
    # If there is no path from start to end, return 0

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.2], start = 0, end = 2
    # Output: 0.25000
    # Explanation: There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

    # Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.3], start = 0, end = 2
    # Output: 0.30000

    # Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1]], succProb = [0.5], start = 0, end = 2
    # Output: 0.00000
    # Explanation: There is no path between 0 and 2.

# âœ… ALGORITHM: DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM
# Dijkstra is used when we are dealing with non-negative weighted edges and trying to find a min/max of those weights
# Create a max heap that pops out the node in the path with the max probability every time
# Once we reached the end node, we can return this max probability

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(E log V)
    # each push/pop operation is O(log V)
    # in the worst case, we can push to heap E times (1 for each edge)
    # -> Overall TC = O(E log V)
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(V^2)
    # worst case: every node is connected to every other node -> SC = O(V^2)
