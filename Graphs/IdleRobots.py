# A robot with coordinates (x, y) is said to be idle if it has a robot located above, below, left, and right of it
# It is guaranteed that no two robots are at the same location
# TODO: Given the locations of n robots where the x- and y-coordinates of the ith robot is (x[i], y[i]), find the number of idle robots

# EXAMPLE:
    # x = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
    # y = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 3]
    # The 10 robots are arranged as follows:

    # 5       x
    # 4
    # 3   x   X   x
    # 2   x   X   x
    # 1   x   x   x
    # 0   1   2   3

    # where each x is a robot and X is an idle robot
        # The robot at (2, 2) is idle because it has robots at (1, 2), (3, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 1) directly to the left, right, up, and down respectively
        # The robot at (2, 3) is idle because it has robots at (1, 3), (3, 3), (2, 5), and (2, 2) directly to the left, right, up, and down respectively
    # There are 2 idle robots in this arrangement
