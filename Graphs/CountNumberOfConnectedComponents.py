# GIVEN:
    # graph, the adjacency list of an undirected graph

# TASK:
    # return the number of connected components in the graph
        # i.e. return the number of separate connected graphs

###########################################################################################################

# âœ… ALGORITHM: RECURSIVE DFS
# define a recursive dfs function that returns False if current node is in visited; returns True after completely traversing across a connected graph
# Traverse graph and call dfs() on each node while keeping track of visited nodes
    # if True is returned, it means one connected graph has finished traversing -> increment counter
# return counter

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(e), e = no. of edges
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n), n = no. of nodes
