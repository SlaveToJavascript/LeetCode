# GIVEN:
    # graph, the adjacency list of an undirected graph

# TASK:
    # return the size (i.e. no. of nodes) of the largest connected component (graph)

###########################################################################################################

# âœ… ALGORITHM: RECURSIVE DFS
# define a recursive dfs function that returns the size (i.e. no. of nodes) of a connected graph component
# call the recursive dfs function on every node in graph to get the maximum size

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(e), e = no. of edges
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n), n = no. of nodes
