# GIVEN:
    # a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n
    # array, times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target

# TASK:
    # We will send a signal from a given node k
    # Return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal
    # If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1

# EXAMPLES:
# Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
# Output: 2

# Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
# Output: 1

# Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
# Output: -1

# âœ… ALGORITHM: DJIKSTRA'S ALGORITHM
# Create a min heap that pops out the node in the path with the min total time
# Once we have visited all n nodes, we can return this min total time

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(E log V)
    # each push/pop operation is O(log V)
    # in the worst case, we can push to heap E times (1 for each edge)
    # -> Overall TC = O(E log V)
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(V^2)
    # worst case: every node is connected to every other node -> SC = O(V^2)

    return -1 # if no min. total time has been returned, it means we can't visit all nodes -> return -1
