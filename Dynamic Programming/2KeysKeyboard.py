# There is only one character 'A' on the screen of a notepad. You can perform one of two operations on this notepad for each step:
    # Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the screen (a partial copy is not allowed).
    # Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.
# Given an integer n, return the minimum number of operations to get the character 'A' exactly n times on the screen.

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: n = 3
    # Output: 3
    # Explanation: Initially, we have one character 'A'.
    # In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
    # In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
    # In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.

    # Input: n = 1
    # Output: 0

# âœ… ALGORITHM 1: DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING (BOTTOM-UP i.e. MEMOIZATION) my solution
# ! MAIN IDEA: if n is even, dp[n] = dp[n//2] + 2 (+2 for 1 copy and 1 paste); if n is odd, we find the largest divisor of n and take dp[n] = dp[largest_divisor_of_n] + n//largest_divisor_of_n (+1 for 1 copy and n//largest_divisor_of_n - 1 pastes)

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n^2)
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)
