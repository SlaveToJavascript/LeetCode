# Tags: dplc, topinterview150lc, #70

# You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top
# Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps
# In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: n = 2
    # Output: 2
    # Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
    # 1. 1 step + 1 step
    # 2. 2 steps

    # Input: n = 3
    # Output: 3
    # Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
    # 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
    # 2. 1 step + 2 steps
    # 3. 2 steps + 1 step

# âœ… ALGORITHM 1: RECURSION, TOP-DOWN (time limit exceeded!)
# If n == 1, there is only 1 way to climb the stair
# If n == 2, there are two ways: climb two 1-step stairs or one 2-step stair
# For any other n, the no. of ways to climb to step n = no. of ways to climb to step n-1 + no. of ways to climb to step n-2
    # because at the (n-1)th step, you can take 1 more step to reach n, and at the (n-2)th step, you can take a 2-step jump to reach n

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(2^n) ðŸ‘Ž
    # each call generates 2 more calls, forming a binary tree of calls, where n is the depth of the tree
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)
    # due to depth of recursion stack

def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
        
    return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2)
