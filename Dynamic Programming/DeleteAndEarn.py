# GIVEN:
    # an integer array, nums, of points that can be earned

# TASK:
    # maximize the no. of points earned by performing the following operation any no. of times:
        # Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points
        # Afterwards, you must delete every occurrence of nums[i]-1 and nums[i]+1

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: nums = [3,4,2]
    # Output: 6
    # Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
    # - Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
    # - Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
    # You earn a total of 6 points.

    # Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
    # Output: 9
    # Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
    # - Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
    # - Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
    # - Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
    # You earn a total of 9 points.

# âœ… ALGORITHM 1: ITERATIVE DP
# Hint: If you take a number i, have to delete all i-1's and i+1's, so you might as well take all i's (to maximize no. of points earned)
# For each num in nums, add it to a dictionary as key and its corresponding value as frequency in nums
# Create integer array dp of len(dictionary) (where each dp[i] should be the max no. of points that can be earned up till i)
# But first, start by populating dp with total points earned from deleting each no.
    # i.e. each number (key) in dictonary * frequency (value) of that number
# also get a list, s, of unique sorted integers in nums (which should have the same length as dp)
# formula for each dp[i] (where dp[i] = max no. of points that can be earned up till i):
    # if s[i]-s[i-1] == 1, dp[i] = max(dp[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1])
    # else, dp[i] = dp[i] + dp[i-1]
# return the last element in dp

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n logn), to sort s
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n), for dictionary and dp
