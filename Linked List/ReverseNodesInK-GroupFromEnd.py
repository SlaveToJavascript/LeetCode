# GIVEN:
    # head of a linked list, head
    # positive integer, k, which is less than or equal to the length of the linked list

# TASK:
    # reverse the nodes of the list k at a time from THE END OF THE LL, and return modified list

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
    # Output: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]

    # Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
    # Output: [1, 2, 5, 4, 3]

    # Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], k = 4
    # Output: [1,5,4,3,2,9,8,7,6]

# âœ… ALGORITHM 1
# Main idea: 
    # 1. reverse entire linked list 
    # 2. get every k-chunk of the reversed list,
    # 3. for each chunk, keep track of groupPrev (the starting node of the previous chunk) as groupPrev will be chained behind this current chunk, and keep track of groupNext (the node after the current chunk) as groupNext will be the starting node of the next chunk
    # 4. for every k-chunk, chain the last node of the chunk to the first node of the previous chunk (or chain to null if the current k-chunk is the first we've processed)
    # 5. any remaining chunks with length < k will be chained to the front of the resulting linked list

# e.g. 
    # 1. [1,2,3,4,5] -> reverse -> [5,4,3,2,1]
    # 2. first k-chunk = [5,4]
    # 3. groupPrev = null (since we are currently at the 1st chunk so this 1st chunk will become the last chunk in the resulting linked list -> therefore it should point to null), groupNext = 3 (3 is the node after chunk [5,4])
    # 4. Change 4's next pointer to point to groupPrev (which is null here)
    # 4a. Update groupPrev with 5 (the starting node of the current chunk) -> this updated groupPrev value is to be used for the next chunk i.e. [3,2]
        # this is because the next chunk, [3,2], is to be chained in front of 5 in the resulting LL
    # 4b. To iterate to the next chunk, update chunkStart = groupNext (i.e. 3), as groupNext represents the node that came after our previous chunk [5,4] -> now it will be the first node of our next chunk [3,4]
    # 5. After the iteration, chunkStart will be the node that comes after the last k-chunk (chunkStart will be null if there are no more remaining nodes after the last k-chunk i.e. if length of the linked list is a multiple of k)
    # 5a. If chunkStart is not null (i.e. there are remaining nodes after the last k-chunk), we iterate to the tail of the last non-k chunk, and chain the last node of this non-k chunk to groupPrev (since groupPrev is the 1st node of the last chunk that we processed) -> return chunkStart
    # 5b. If chunkStart is null (i.e. there are no more remaining nodes after the last k-chunk) -> return groupPrev (i.e. the 1st node of the last chunk we processed)

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

        while curr and k > 1: # it's k>1 and not k>0 as it takes k-1 jumps from starting node of k-chunk to reach ending node of k-chunk
