# GIVEN:
    # the head of a singly linked list
    # 2 integers, left and right, where left <= right

# TASK:
    # reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
    # Output: [1,4,3,2,5]

    # Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
    # Output: [5]

        # before_left will point to the head of the reversed LL in the resulting LL
    position = 0 # track which position we're at; dummy node not counted so position = 0
