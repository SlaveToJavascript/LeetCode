# GIVEN:
    # the heads of two sorted linked lists, list1 and list2

# TASK:
    # merge the two lists into one sorted list and return it

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
    # Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

    # Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
    # Output: []

    # Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
    # Output: [0]
