# GIVEN:
    # An integer array, nums, sorted in ascending order with distinct values
        # nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k
        # e.g. [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] rotated at pivot index 3 -> [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
    # an integer target

# TASK:
    # return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
    # Output: 4

    # Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
    # Output: -1

    # Input: nums = [1], target = 0
    # Output: -1

# âœ… ALGORITHM 1: BINARY SEARCH
# for a rotated sorted array, e.g. [4,5,6,7,0,1,2],
    # the left sorted portion is [4,5,6,7]
    # the right sorted portion is [0,1,2]
# first, we need to check if element at mid is in the left or right sorted array

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(logn)
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
