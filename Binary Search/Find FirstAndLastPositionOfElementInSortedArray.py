# GIVEN:
    # an array of integers, nums, sorted in non-decreasing order

# TASK:
    # find the starting and ending position of a given target value
    # If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1]

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
    # Output: [3,4]

    # Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
    # Output: [-1,-1]

    # Input: nums = [1], target = 1
    # Output: [0,0]

    # Input: nums = [], target = 0
    # Output: [-1,-1]

# âœ… ALGORITHM: BINARY SEARCH
# Do binary search to find target in nums
# Since nums is sorted, after we find a num that is = target, keep checking for its consecutive elements on the left and right if they are = target, and add them to result if they are

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(logn)
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
