# GIVEN:
    # root of a binary tree
    # integer, targetSum

# TASK:
    # return a 2D list of all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the path = targetSum

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
    # Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]
    # Explanation: There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:
    # 5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22
    # 5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22

    # Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
    # Output: []

    # Input: root = [1,2], targetSum = 0
    # Output: []
