# GIVEN:
    # root of a binary tree
    # list of node values to delete

# TASK:
    # After deleting nodes with values in to_delete, we are left with a forest (disjoint union of trees)
    # Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
    # Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]

    # Input: root = [1,2,4,null,3], to_delete = [3]
    # Output: [[1,2,4]]

# âœ… ALGORITHM 1: DFS (POSTORDER)
# When we delete a node, we also have to deal with its children
    # Recursively, we try to delete smaller and smaller trees
# When we delete a node, its children (if any) will automatically become new roots
    # However, we can't add these children (new roots) to our answer automatically, as these children's children etc. also have to be checked for deletions

# While traversing a tree, at every node there are 2 options:
# 1. delete the node -> we will delete it and then recurse the dfs into its children
# 2. don't delete the node -> check if we need to delete any of its children 
                                # if yes, i.e. must delete child(ren) -> set child(ren) to null
                                # recurse the dfs on its child(ren)

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
    # DFS visits each node once
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)

            dfs(node.right, to_delete, True)
