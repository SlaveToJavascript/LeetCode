# Tags: dfslc, postorderlc, binarytreelc, #1110

# GIVEN:
    # root of a binary tree
    # list of node values to delete

# TASK:
    # After deleting nodes with values in to_delete, we are left with a forest (disjoint union of trees)
    # Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
    # Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]

    # Input: root = [1,2,4,null,3], to_delete = [3]
    # Output: [[1,2,4]]

# âœ… ALGORITHM 1: DFS (POSTORDER)
    # https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr-HUE_cEQ0&t=667s
# When we delete a node, we also have to deal with its children
    # Recursively, we try to delete smaller and smaller trees
# When we delete a node, its children (if any) will automatically become new roots
    # However, we can't add these children (new roots) to our answer automatically, as these children's children etc. also have to be checked for deletions

# MAIN IDEA:
    # While traversing a tree, at every node there are 2 options:
    # 1. delete the node -> we will delete it and then recurse the dfs into its children to process them
    # 2. don't delete the node -> check if we need to delete any of its children 
                                    # if yes, i.e. must delete child(ren)
                                    # recurse the dfs on its child(ren) to process them
                                    # set child(ren) to null

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n) + O(d)
    # n = no. of nodes
    # d = no. of nodes to delete
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n) + O(d)
    # O(n) for the recursion call stack
    # O(d) for to_delete set

    to_delete = set(to_delete) # change to_delete array to set for quick lookups

            dfs(node.right, True)

                if node.right.val in to_delete: # if right child needs to be deleted,
