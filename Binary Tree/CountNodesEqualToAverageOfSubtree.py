# MEDIUM
# Tags: binarytreelc, dfslc, #2265

# GIVEN:
    # root of a binary tree

# TASKS:
    # return the no. of nodes where the node's val is equal to the average of the values in its subtree
    # NOTE: The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and ROUNDED DOWN to the nearest integer

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: root = [4,8,5,0,1,null,6]
    # Output: 5
    # Explanation: 
    # For the node with value 4: The average of its subtree is (4 + 8 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 6) / 6 = 24 / 6 = 4.
    # For the node with value 5: The average of its subtree is (5 + 6) / 2 = 11 / 2 = 5.
    # For the node with value 0: The average of its subtree is 0 / 1 = 0.
    # For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.
    # For the node with value 6: The average of its subtree is 6 / 1 = 6.

    # Input: root = [1]
    # Output: 1
    # Explanation: For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.

# âœ… ALGORITHM: RECURSIVE DFS (return both sum of vals and count of nodes together)
# dfs() function returns the total sum of values and the total count of nodes in the tree/subtree
    # i.e. return (sum_of_vals, count_of_nodes)

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
    # each node is visited once
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(h)
    # h = height of tree = O(log n) on average
    # h = n in worst case (skewed tree)

        total_sum = left_sum + right_sum + node.val
        total_count = left_count + right_count + 1
