# EASY
# Tags: binarytreelc, dfslc, #543

# GIVEN:
    # the root of a binary tree

# TASK:
    # return the length of the diameter of the tree
    # diameter of a binary tree = length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree
        # This path may or may not pass through the root

# EXAMPLES:
    # Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
    # Output: 3
    # Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

    # Input: root = [1,2]
    # Output: 1

# âœ… ALGORITHM: RECURSIVE DFS
    # https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkxqA8Rfv04
# NOTE: diameter of binary tree = max(left height, right height)
    # height = no. of edges in longest path from node to a leaf
# for each node, calculate height of left and right subtrees, and calculate diameter at each node (left subtree height + right subtree height), updating max diameter found so far

# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
    # DFS visits each node once
# SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(h)
    # h = height of tree
